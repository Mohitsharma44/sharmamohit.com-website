# Biography

I am a DevOps engineer with strong Linux background and over 4 years of experience in developing and implementing software and networking infrastructure for large-scale deployments of remote sensing and cyber physical systems.
<br/>
Throughout my career, I have been responsible for administering, architecting and orchestrating the compute and storage systems and for building secure IoT platforms using CI/CD framework. Since most of my work involves scripting, be it for data analysis or orchestrating the infrastructure, I use Python as my weapon of choice.
<br/>
In the past, I have also worked as an adjunct professor at NYU, teaching graduate students broad topics such as wireless sensor networks, Internet of Things and micro services architecture for which I designed [Urban Computing Skills Lab](https://ucsl.cusp.nyu.edu), an online class, for incoming graduate students. This helpef them get up to speed on python and data analysis skills for Masters in Urban Informatics.
<br/>
I am also a researcher fueled by my passion to understand the working of the cities from a physical sciences point of view. I am actively involved with [Urban Observatory](http://cuspuo.org) and [Sounds of New York City](https://sonycproject.com). I actively contribute to, and have published a few papers with my colleagues, in these two projects.
<br/><br/>
I received my Masters from NYU Tandon School of Engineering in Computer Systems and Networking where I designed [Citysynth](https://sharmamohit.com/work/project/citysynth/) a prototype infrastructure that utilizes window mounted cellphones to continually capture images of New York City skyline and perform on-the-fly processing to provide deeper understanding about how the city works.
<br/>
I consider myself to be a *forever student*, eager to build on my academic background and stay in tune with the latest technology through continued professional development.
