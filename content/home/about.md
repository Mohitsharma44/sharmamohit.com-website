# Biography

I am an Associate Research Scientist at the New York University, Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP). My research interestâ€™s lie in the Internet of 
Things (IoT), with a focus on the networking aspects. I am an engineer by training and a researcher by profession. My work includes the development and imple
mentation of the software and networking infrastructure for large scale deployments of cyber-physical systems. To date, I have played a major infrastructure 
development role in multiple projects at CUSP including Urban Observatory and Sounds of New York City.

I received my Masters from NYU Tandon School of Engineering in Computer Systems and Networking where I designed a prototype infrastructure that utilizes wind
ow mounted cellphones to continually capture images of New York City skyline to provide deeper understanding about how the city works.
