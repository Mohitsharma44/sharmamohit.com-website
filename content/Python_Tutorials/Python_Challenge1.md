##Question 1:

**Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. 
The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be `i*j`.**

> Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,..,Y-1.


#### Example
Suppose the following inputs are given to the program:
3,5
Then, the output of the program should be:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]] 

#### Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, 
it should be assumed to be a console input in a comma-separated form.

--------------

## Question2:

** Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.**

#### Example:
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

`hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again`

Then, the output should be:

`again and hello makes perfect practice world`

#### Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
We use set container to remove duplicated data automatically and then use sorted() to sort the data.

---------------

## Question 3:
**Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.**

#### Example:
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

`Hello world`

Then, the output should be:

`UPPER CASE 1`

`LOWER CASE 9`

#### Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
