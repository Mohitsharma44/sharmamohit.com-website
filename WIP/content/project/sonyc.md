## Overview:

Noise pollution is one of the top most quality of life issues for urban residents in the United States. It has been estimated that 9 out of 10 adults in NYC are exposed to excessive noise levels. Such levels of exposure have proven effects on health causing sleep disruption, hypertension and so on. It is especially harmful for the children. Studies have proved that noise pollution leads to learning and cognitive impairment in children.

NYC has tried to regulate the sources of noise since 1930â€™s but just like other cities around the world, lacks the resources to systematically monitor noise pollution, enforce its mitigation and validate effectiveness of such actions.

Currently the city monitors the noise via its 311 service, which is for civil complaints and as of 2014 it receives about 400 noise complaint calls per day.

Unfortunately the combination of limited human resources, transient nature of sound and relative low priority of the noise complaints causes slow or nonexistent responses.

In order to address these limitations, the objectives of our project is to create technological solutions for:

- Systematic and constant monitoring of noise pollution.

- Accurate description of acoustic environments in terms of its composing sources.

- Enabling the city agencies to take effective, information-driven action for noise mitigation.


We plan to achieve these objectives by implementing a novel CPS system that we call **SoNYC, Sounds of New York City**.

This system includes:

- A distributed network of sensors for large scale noise monitoring.
  - The sensors incorporate advanced processing capabilities and produce acoustic data up to the city agency standards

- These sensors make use of cutting-edge machine listening methods to constantly provide a rich description of their acoustic environment.

- Information from the network flows through a cyber infrastructure that analyzes, retrieves and visualizes the data to facilitate the identification of important patterns of noise pollution intended for decision makers at our partner city agencies to strategically deploy the human resources at their disposal to act on the physical world.
