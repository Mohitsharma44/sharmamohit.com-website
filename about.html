<p>Dobler et al., 2015, Information Systems, Issue: “Mining Urban Data”                June 2015</p>

<p>A fundamentally new methodology for quantifying the “pulse” of a city via time-dependent changes in the urban lightscape. Use of astronomical techniques to analyze the dynamics of city lights applies physics to the new realm of urban science and human behavior, complementing the use of statistical physics for scaling and modeling of urban growth.</p>

<h4 id="sonyc-sound-of-new-york-city">SoNYC (Sound of New York City)</h4>

<ul>
<li>An innovative and unprecedented technique of using NYC as a “lab” with the aim of creating a model that can be utilized and implemented in other cities around the world.</li>
<li>Deployed initial prototype network of next generation sensors running linux core and python for capturing data and relaying the information in near real-time.</li>
<li>SoNYC server is implemented using python, supporting authentication and control over all the remote devices with more than 12K concurrent connections.</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="citysynth">CitySynth</h4>

<ul>
<li>Devised a cost efficient and secure technique for capturing the images, encryption and intelligent transmission through dynamically created secure channels to the server. The entire project is based on a SDN-like architecture. The android application developed for this project is resilient to freezes, crashes and power failure. Currently the code is being ported to python for better efficiency and control over devices.</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="software-defined-radio">Software Defined Radio</h4>

<ul>
<li>Researching on innovative ways to develop a comprehensive system that provides the capability to detect and track urban crowd formation by scanning and analyzing the GSM uplink and downlink part of the RF spectrum and identifying anomalies using ultra cheap RTL-SDR.</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="wireless-control-using-rf">Wireless Control Using RF</h4>

<ul>
<li>A prototype implementation of sensor and actuator network for controlling remote end devices such as robots using hand gestures by using low power zigbee module for communication.</li>
</ul>
