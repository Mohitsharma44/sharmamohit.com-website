Mohit Sharma's website
===================


This is the source for http://sharmamohit.com. I use Hugo to take the source here and create a static site which can be found at [sharmamohit](http://sharmamohit.com)

Hugo, is new idea around making website creation simple again. Hugo flexibly works with many formats and is ideal for blogs, docs, portfolios and much more. Hugo's speed fosters creativity and makes building a website fun again. To know more about hugo, head over to their official website: [GoHugo.io](https://gohugo.io)
